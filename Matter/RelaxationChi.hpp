//!  Calculates RHS for relaxation of the conformal factor, for initial conditions
/*!
     The class calculates the RHS evolution for the relaxation of the conformal
     factor chi, in order to satisfy the Hamiltonian constraint for some general
     matter configuration. It assumes that the other variables (K, h_ij etc) are
     fixed and satisfy the Momentum constraint. It calculates the RHS at each step
     as the relaxation speed multiplied by the error in the Hamiltonian constraint.
     It is extremely inefficient and takes a long time to converge, but it works
     provided that there is indeed a sensible solution (note that it can converge
     to \chi = 0 everywhere if there is not, so one must always check it is converging
     on something sensible).
